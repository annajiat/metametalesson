## June 29th (Darya)

- Oof! We're approved! Now we have to figure out what we're doing... Swamped with work this week, so have asked Brian to do the liasing with central bit that is time sensitive.
- Personal aim for end of week: to come up with a plan of attack and some deadlines, and share with Brian

## July 1 (Brian)

- Ok, being clear on comms channels and responsibilities is critical. Looks like we were doing a directed graph of comms. Me to central, central to darya, and darya to me.
- Always check with worldtimebuddy on timing, and pay attention to which row one is looking at. 

## July 10 (Brian)

- Clearly, working on this right after being lead instructor for an online carpentry is... wise, right? 
- Objective for this hour is to figure out a markdown slide workflow that works with github pages so we're not mucking about with infrastructure and so our slides are version controlled. Also I want a pony.
