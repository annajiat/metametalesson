TODO Darya
  - Notes to self: make google docs for landing, plus x 6 for final challenge
  - Make sure to mention we'll publish google docs later
  - Make sure to have more visuals, even given limitation of tech stack

TODO Brian
  - Make sure to have slides for all agenda items assigned to me before saturday.

# Lesson co-development using reverse design: a worked example

![Carpentries Logo](images/TheCarpentries.svg)

By: Dr Darya Vanichinka (University of Sydney) and Dr Brian Ballsun-Stanton (Macquarie University)

---

# Agenda: Part 1

1. Who are we? What are we doing here? What's going on?
1. Restate our objective
1. Disclaimer: this is our alpha run (remember this for later)
<!-- 1. Aside: Common traps -->
1. D What to teach: Making a target audience
1. D What to teach: Making learner profiles
1. D What to teach: Mapping skills and goals from learners
1. B Aside: Designing a carpentries workshop versus designing a lesson
1. B Challenges: Finding data
1. D Exercise: Form groups, make personae, make summative task to test goal.

---
# Agenda: Part 2

<!-- 1. Challenges: Turning it into a teachable dataset -->
1. DB Reflection: reflect on group pages
1. D Reminder: formative assessments
1. B Narrative: What do people need to know to complete each formative assessment ()
1. B First draft: Write an outline of your narrative for each code chunk
1. B Aside: Brian's theory of outlines. What to say is different from how to say
1. B First draft: Allocate skills as learning objectives to lessons.
1. B First draft: Allocate challenge+code+narrative to each episode to satisfy learning objectives
1. D Challenges: Making a challenge to exercise a skill
1. D Challenges: Designing a good MCQ
1. D Challenges: Parson's problems
1. D Challenges: Fill in the blank
1. D Challenges: Change context
1. B Exercise: Design formative assessments needed to accomplish summative task.

---
# Agenda: Part 3

1. DB Reflection: Reflect on choice of formative assessments.
1. B Aside: Temporal budgets and overkill
1. B Aside: How does live coding factor into this?
<!-- Live coding is the simplest possible formative assessment: follow along.
 -->
1. B Time yourself talking about the code you're typing, and then *do* your challenges. This *2 is your minimum time (you already know the answers).
1. D Run a pilot: Teach your lesson from outline to your helpers and co-instructors
1. D Run a pilot: While issues: iterate
1. D Run a pilot: Flesh out narrative from outline, move outline into instructor notes
1. B Summative exercise: proving that we've designed a workshop??

Using the combined group doc of your topic, plan a workshop.
This workshop should have personae, a summative assessment, formative assessments, a few bulletpoints per formative assessment, and be sorted into episodes. 



<!-- 
1. First draft: Write key points summarising capabilities from challenges
1. First draft: Check that your key points match your skills
1. First draft: Write framing questions -->

---
<!-- # Agenda: Part 4

1. Run a pilot: Publish alpha lesson
1. Second pilot: Run a test workshop, and start from the top. 
1. Aside: How to use markdown for the lesson infrastructure.

# Introduction

- Who we are (faces)

---
# Real step 1: Who are your learners?

- Reverse design: start with who your learners are and what they should be able to DO at the end of the course.
- Everything is developed from that premise

---

# Draft personas for this workshops

.right[![Carpentries Logo](images/helena-lopes-PGnqT0rXWLs-unsplash.jpg)]

- K - works as a trainer embedded at a Uni. Has done a lot of training but never developed any courses before.
- M - attended Toby's talk, Carpentries instructor wanting to stretch their wings and begin contributing to some of the incubator lessons
- S - another instructor trainer with extensive course developer experience. Interested in what we have to say "just because".
- Z - watching session later on Youtube, not familiar with Carpentries philosophy or teaching style
- ...

# Add "flesh" to the personas: K

<!--
  Link to rest of personas fleshed out here
  Also need a photo
-->
- K is a PhD-qualified particle physicist who learned to use python for research work. During PhD, delivering introductory programming training with a cross-university training organisation as a casual tutor. 
- After graduation, found employment with this organisation as a full-time trainer. 
- Would like to grow in role by developing new training, and doesn't really know where to start.
- Has tried by making a list of topics to cover in a new course.
- Hasn't been exposed to any learning theory, received any training in instruction beyond that learned from peers on the job - and doesn't feel comfortable reaching out to trainers around who do have some of this background for support, as most of them are not employed on a full-time contracts (imposter syndrome). 
- Deeply concerned about climate change.

# Think about what learners will be able to DO at the end


- *Overall*: To have a sense of what the reverse design process looks like, and - with looking at other resources too - begin to develop a lesson using its core principles 

### How do we know learners have been able to do this? 

- Summative assessment: how is the learner - you - going to show us that you've learned what we're trying to teach?

- Well, to develop a course plan  or a mini-course, as that's more feasible in < 2 hours
- It will be a group task (peer learning)

# Our summative task for today: group development of mini-courses in < 2 hours!

Options:
<!--this needs an image-->

1. Starting a new job off on the right foot (the first month)
1. Diet and exercise to stay healthy 

<!--Each of us reflects on multiple groups in same google doc-->

---
# Our summative task for today: why did we choose these?

Options:

1. Starting a new job off on the right foot (the first month)
2. Getting the most out of going to a networking event or meetup
3. Diet and exercise to stay healthy
4. Developing a presentation for CarpentryCon (metametameta)

### Assess relevance/alignment of summative assessment with persona learning goals!

<!--

- "Generic" topics - most people will be able to contribute

<!--Brian-->
<!--Also: inclusivity in technical training-->

# Our summative task for today: group development of mini-courses in < 2 hours!

<!--Group work google docs picture here-->

### Challenge 1:

In your breakout rooms (10 min or until 1st break?):
1. Introduce yourselves briefly
2. Draft two short personas for your courses
3. Agree on a summative assessment task
4. Reflect on the alignment of that assessment task with learning goals

---
<!--Come back. Summary of highlights from each group (in chat if HEAPS of people//time) -->
---

# What are the key tasks needed to achieve this?

1. Personas *
2. Learning outcome - a summative assessment task *
3. Breaking that summative assessment into subtasks (this step! - usually a list of things you need to do to get from A to B)

### For this course:
2. Identifying formative assessments that allow us to practice/build up to being able to execute those subtasks
3. [Knowing the arsenal of types of formative assessments that can be combined for effective learning, and the pros/cons of each]
4. Identifying the minimum necessarily information for getting students "to" the assessment
5. Reviewing the series through the persona lens & identifying time constraints/skippable-if-need-be formative assessments


---
# Formative assessments
- Form the core of learning
- 

<!--I think we'll need to use programming ones here /or it may be pedagogogic-->
<!--Could also use programming examples combined with boiling an egg?-->

---
# Other stuff we did (without being explicit)
1. Tried to combine visual and auditory information
2. Didn't given the whole picture at once (but this can be useful as well)
