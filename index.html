# Lesson co-development using reverse design: a worked example

![Carpentries Logo](images/TheCarpentries.svg)

By: Dr Darya Vanichinka (University of Sydney) and Dr Brian Ballsun-Stanton (Macquarie University)

# Agenda: Part 1

1. Who are we? What are we doing here? What's going on?
1. Restate our objective
1. Aside: Common traps
1. What to teach: Making a target audience
1. What to teach: Making learner profiles
1. What to teach: Mapping skills and goals from learners
1. Aside: Designing a carpentries workshop versus designing a lesson

---
# Agenda: Part 2

1. Challenges: Finding data
1. Challenges: Turning it into a teachable dataset
1. Reminder: formative assessments
1. Challenges: Making a challenge to exercise a skill
1. Challenges: Designing a good MCQ
1. Challenges: Parson's problems
1. Challenges: Fill in the blank
1. Challenges: Change context
1. Aside: Temporal budgets and overkill

---
# Agenda: Part 3

1. First draft: Planning live coding to teach skills per challenge
1. First draft: Test your code chunks (and time yourself)
1. First draft: Write an outline of your narrative for each code chunk
1. Aside: Brian's theory of outlines. What to say is different from how to say
1. First draft: Allocate skills as learning objectives to lessons.
1. First draft: Allocate challenge+code+narrative to each episode to satisfy learning objectives
1. First draft: Write key points summarising capabilities from challenges
1. First draft: Check that your key points match your skills
1. First draft: Write framing questions

---
# Agenda: Part 4

1. Run a pilot: Teach your lesson from outline to your helpers and co-instructors
1. Run a pilot: While issues: iterate
1. Run a pilot: Flesh out narrative from outline, move outline into instructor notes
1. Run a pilot: Publish alpha lesson
1. Second pilot: Run a test workshop, and start from the top. 
1. Aside: How to use markdown for the lesson infrastructure.

# Introduction

- Who we are (faces)

---
# Real step 1: Who are your learners?

- Reverse design: start with who your learners are and what they should be able to DO at the end of the course.
- Everything is developed from that lesson

# Draft personas for this workshops

.right[![Carpentries Logo](images/helena-lopes-PGnqT0rXWLs-unsplash.jpg)]

- K - works as a trainer embedded at a Uni. Has done a lot of training but never developed any courses before in his life.
- M - attended Toby's talk, Carpentries instructor wanting to stretch their wings and begin contributing to some of the incubator lessons
- S - another instructor trainer with extensive course developer experience. Interested in what we have to say "just because".
- Z - watching session later on Youtube, is not familiar with Carpentries philosophy or teaching style
- ...

# Add "flesh" to the personas: Kevin

- K(evin) is a PhD-qualified particle physicist who learned to use python for most of his research work. During his PhD, he also supported himself by casually delivering introductory programming training with a cross-university training organisation. 
- After graduation, he found employment with this organisation as a full-time trainer. 
- He would like to grow in his role by developing new training, and doesn't really know where to start.
- He's tried by making a list of topics he wants to cover in a new course.
- He hasn't been exposed to any learning theory, received any training in instruction beyond what he learned from peers on the job - and he doesn't feel comfortable reaching out to trainers around him who do have some of this background for support, as most of them are not - like him - employed on a full-time contract. 
- Kevin is deeply concerned about climate change.

# Think about what learners will be able to DO at the end


- *Overall*: To have a sense of what the reverse design process looks like, and - with looking at other resources too - begin to develop a lesson using its core principles 

### How do we know learners have been able to do this? 

- Summative assessment: how is the learner - you - going to show us that you've learned what we're trying to teach?

- Well, to develop a course plan  or a mini-course, as that's more feasible in < 2 hours
- It will be a group task (peer learning)

# Our summative task for today: group development of mini-courses in < 2 hours!

Options:
<!--this needs an image-->

1. Starting a new job off on the right foot (the first month)
2. Getting the most out of going to a networking event or meetup
3. Diet and exercise to stay healthy

# What are the key tasks needed to achieve this?

1. Personas *
2. Learning outcome - a summative assessment task *
3. Breaking that summative assessment into subtasks (this step!)
4. Identifying formative assessments that allow us to
