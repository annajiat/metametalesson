TODO Darya
  - Notes to self: make google docs for landing, plus x 2 for final challenge
  - Make sure to mention we'll publish google docs later
  - Make sure to have more visuals, even given limitation of tech stack

TODO Brian
  - Make sure to have slides for all agenda items assigned to me before saturday.

- L - attended Toby's talk, Carpentries instructor wanting to stretch their wings and begin contributing to some of the incubator lessons
- M - another instructor trainer with extensive course developer experience. Interested in what we have to say "just because".
- N - watching session later on Youtube, not familiar with Carpentries philosophy or teaching style

# Think about what learners will be able to DO at the end


-  To have a sense of what the reverse design process looks like, and - by referring to this presentation and using other resources - begin to develop a lesson using its core principles 

### How do we know learners have been able to do this? 

- <b>Summative assessment</b>: how is the learner - you - going to show us that you've learned what we're trying to teach?

- Well, to develop a course plan  or a mini-course, as that's more feasible in < 2 hours
- It will be a group task: peer learning

# Talk-at-you aside 1: Finding datasets and making them teachable


**Inclusivity in technical training is tricky: start with real data and real scenarios and see the researchers you are teaching.**

- Dataset, scenario, and tools chosen informs:
  - Cognitive load
  - Sense of identification with the problem
  - Motivations
???
Brian

1. B Challenges: Finding data

Also: inclusivity in technical training
--
<!-- Incremental slide -->
- Performance of FAIR data
  - When we use and cite "real" data, we demonstrate "reproducible research" to participants
  - Participants must understand point of data and nature of data in about 5 minutes. **Simplify ruthlessly.**
  - Make sure there's a license which allows this.

--
- Meet learners where they are
  - Carpentries participants have *hugely different* skill sets. 
  - A local lesson can assume shared context, jargon, and competencies. 

???
Brian
B Aside: Designing a carpentries workshop versus designing a lesson

- Skills known by postgrads on the other side of the world, in different faculties should not be assumed.

# Formative Reflection 1: What are the key tasks needed to achieve this?

1. Personas *
2. Learning outcome - a summative assessment task *
3. Breaking that summative assessment into subtasks (this step! - usually a list of things you need to do to get from A to B)

### For this course:
2. Identifying formative assessments that allow us to practice/build up to being able to execute those subtasks
3. [Knowing the arsenal of types of formative assessments that can be combined for effective learning, and the pros/cons of each]
4. Identifying the minimum necessarily information for getting students "to" the assessment
5. Reviewing the series through the persona lens & identifying time constraints/skippable-if-need-be formative assessments
???
5 minutes
Darya + Brian

# Narrative: Skill decomposition, explanation, and setup

* Each formative assessment will expect learners to do something.
* Live coding **is a formative assessment.**
* The narrative is: "What does a learner need to know in order to complete this formative assessment"
   * Intended outcome
   * How do they know they have achieved success?
   * What pattern is the assessment demonstrating?
   * How does this link to the bigger picture?

???
1. B Narrative: What do people need to know to complete each formative assessment ()
1. B First draft: Write an outline of your narrative for each code chunk
---
# Talk-at-you aside 2: Start with an outline, not a script

* An outline specifies *what* you want to say, and how thoughts are arranged
  * Writing a text or script specifies *how* you want to communicate thoughts previously arranged.
  * When designing a work, outline at roughly a 1:4 ratio (1 word of outline for every 4 expected words of script)
  * No sentences!

![:img Meme from The Incredibles - Pixar/Disney, 30%](https://media1.tenor.com/images/b9a827678b058774a279b42084459108/tenor.gif?itemid=4809949)


* We are going to end up throwing most of the text away. 
  * Focus on how ideas relate to each other, not how to express them. 
  * Transitions, callouts, and asides come later. For now, identify only what they need to know in order to accomplish the assessment, how they know they've succeeded, and how it links to the final goal.
* Don't be this slide.
???


---
# Narrative: Allocate skills as learning objectives to the workshop.

* 45 minutes ago, we said to: "Think about what learners will be able to DO at the end"
* What *specific* skills will they need to do that? 
  * Use Bloom's taxonomy words here when listing out the skills they will need.
  * Don't split them apart yet, just get a sense of prerequisites
* These skills are both a functional decomposition of the final goal and specific takeaways that learners will know they have achieved during the workshop. 
* You will be writing challenges to have learners demonstrate to themselves that they can perform each of these skills.

???
Brian
You need to flag/link Bloom's taxonomy here!

1. B First draft: Allocate skills as learning objectives to lessons.

# Making a challenge to exercise a skill
.center[![A subset of the laundry symbols in Australia](images/laundrysymbolsinaustralia.png)]

## [Doing the laundry](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-do-laundry-2146149)
1. Read the labels
2. Sort into whites, coloureds, heavily soiled; subsort by type of fabric (denim vs t-shirts, delicates, wool)/"lintiness"
5. Pre-treat stains before washing, using the appropriate method
4. Select appropriate type and quantity of detergent
6. Pick water temperature and wash cycle
7. Load properly to 2/3 full 
8. After wash, hang or place in dryer, as appropriate to fabric and life

# Aside: How does live coding factor into this?

* Live coding is an assessment
* Attention and accuracy check. 
  * Are they aware of *exactly* what is being written? 
  * Errors
  * Expectations of the medium (precision and syntax)
* It is a formative assessment

<li> Figure out who your learners are and what their goals are. </li>
<li> Create the summative assessment for the lesson to give yourself a target. </li>
<li> Itemize the knowledge and skills that assessment relies on and create formative assessments to check on each while learning is taking place. </li>
<li> Order those formative assessments in a way that respects their dependencies, i.e., so that they build on each other. </li>
<li> Estimate the time required to cover each topic and perform its related formative assessment, then cut material that there isn't time for. </li>
<li> Write lessons to connect each formative assessment to the next (which is usually much easier than writing an entire lesson at once). </li>
<li> Double-check your language and examples to ensure that they address your learners' goals and won't demotivate them. </li>
<li> Derive learning objectives and key points from the lesson to share with your learners and coinstructors. The former makes the lesson findable, while the latter gives you and your coinstructors a quick way to check what the lesson actually covers. </li>
<li> Put everything online under an open license for other people to download, modify, and contribute to. </li>
