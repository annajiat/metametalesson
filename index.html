# Purpose of this workshop

<i> In this session, we demonstrate how the constraints of reverse design reduce the uncertainty of a blank page titled 'Lesson 1'. Nowhere does the Carpentries demonstrate the full cycle of instructional design. We propose this workshop - co-developed by two experienced instructors - using this approach. The process of the development of this workshop is documented and shared as the content of the workshop. Attendees will see how learner personas, faded examples, concept maps, formative and summative assessment create requirements for lesson design.

We provide a worked example of the reverse design process without any assumptions of prior computational knowledge. After the workshop, attendees can combine their experience of the lesson we developed with the process of development, which we share with them, to apply this framework to their own training work. </i>

# Real step 1: Who are your learners?


.center[![Personas Image](images/helena-lopes-PGnqT0rXWLs-unsplash.jpg)]

- Reverse design: start with who your learners are and what they should be able to DO at the end of the course.
- Everything is developed from that premise

- Alex - works as a trainer embedded at a Uni. Has done a lot of training but never developed any courses before.
- Ali - attended Toby's talk, Carpentries instructor wanting to stretch their wings and begin contributing to some of the incubator lessons. Does not "code".
- Uri - another instructor trainer with extensive course developer experience. Interested in what we have to say "just because".
- Drew - watching session later on YouTube, not familiar with Carpentries philosophy or teaching style
- ... (note: all we got from Central was ~60 attendees registered ðŸ˜¢)

# Think about what learners will be able to DO at the end


-  To have a sense of what the reverse design process looks like, and - by referring to this presentation and using other resources - begin to develop a lesson using its core principles 

### How do we know learners have been able to do this? 

- <b>Summative assessment</b>: how is the learner - you - going to show us that you've learned what we're trying to teach?

- Well, to develop a course plan  or a mini-course, as that's more feasible in < 2 hours
- It will be a group task: peer learning

# Talk-at-you aside 1: Finding datasets and making them teachable


**Inclusivity in technical training is tricky: start with real data and real scenarios and see the researchers you are teaching.**

- Dataset, scenario, and tools chosen informs:
  - Cognitive load
  - Sense of identification with the problem
  - Motivations
???
Brian

1. B Challenges: Finding data

Also: inclusivity in technical training
--
<!-- Incremental slide -->
- Performance of FAIR data
  - When we use and cite "real" data, we demonstrate "reproducible research" to participants
  - Participants must understand point of data and nature of data in about 5 minutes. **Simplify ruthlessly.**
  - Make sure there's a license which allows this.

--
- Meet learners where they are
  - Carpentries participants have *hugely different* skill sets. 
  - A local lesson can assume shared context, jargon, and competencies. 

???
Brian
B Aside: Designing a carpentries workshop versus designing a lesson

- Skills known by postgrads on the other side of the world, in different faculties should not be assumed.

# Formative Reflection 1: What are the key tasks needed to achieve this?

1. Personas *
2. Learning outcome - a summative assessment task *
3. Breaking that summative assessment into subtasks (this step! - usually a list of things you need to do to get from A to B)

### For this course:
2. Identifying formative assessments that allow us to practice/build up to being able to execute those subtasks
3. [Knowing the arsenal of types of formative assessments that can be combined for effective learning, and the pros/cons of each]
4. Identifying the minimum necessarily information for getting students "to" the assessment
5. Reviewing the series through the persona lens & identifying time constraints/skippable-if-need-be formative assessments
???
5 minutes
Darya + Brian

???
Need to note somewhere that formative assessments are also helpful for us to diagnose current learner mental models, and that they help us reduce cognitive load

---
# Skill decomposition, explanation, and setup

* Each formative assessment will expect learners to do something.
* Live coding **is a formative assessment.**
* The narrative is: "What does a learner need to know in order to complete this formative assessment"
   * Intended outcome
   * How do they know they have achieved success?
   * What pattern is the assessment demonstrating?
   * How does this link to the bigger picture?

???
1. B Narrative: What do people need to know to complete each formative assessment ()
1. B First draft: Write an outline of your narrative for each code chunk
---
# Talk-at-you aside 2: Start with an outline, not a script

* An outline specifies *what* you want to say, and how thoughts are arranged
  * Writing a text or script specifies *how* you want to communicate thoughts previously arranged.
  * When designing a work, outline at roughly a 1:4 ratio (1 word of outline for every 4 expected words of script)
  * No sentences!

![:img Meme from The Incredibles - Pixar/Disney, 30%](https://media1.tenor.com/images/b9a827678b058774a279b42084459108/tenor.gif?itemid=4809949)


* We are going to end up throwing most of the text away. 
  * Focus on how ideas relate to each other, not how to express them. 
  * Transitions, callouts, and asides come later. For now, identify only what they need to know in order to accomplish the assessment, how they know they've succeeded, and how it links to the final goal.
* Don't be this slide.
???
Brian

---
# Allocate skills as learning objectives to the workshop.

* 45 minutes ago, we said to: "Think about what learners will be able to DO at the end"
* What *specific* skills will they need to do that? 
  * Use Bloom's taxonomy words here when listing out the skills they will need.
  * Don't split them apart yet, just get a sense of prerequisites
* These skills are both a functional decomposition of the final goal and specific takeaways that learners will know they have achieved during the workshop. 
* You will be writing challenges to have learners demonstrate to themselves that they can perform each of these skills.

You need to flag/link Bloom's taxonomy here!

## [Doing the laundry](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-do-laundry-2146149)
1. Read the labels
2. Sort into whites, coloureds, heavily soiled; subsort by type of fabric (denim vs t-shirts, delicates, wool)/"lintiness"
5. Pre-treat stains before washing, using the appropriate method
4. Select appropriate type and quantity of detergent
6. Pick water temperature and wash cycle
7. Load properly to 2/3 full 
8. After wash, hang or place in dryer, as appropriate to fabric and life

A good MCQ tests for conceptual misunderstanding rather than simple factual knowledge. If you are having a hard time coming up with diagnostic distractors, then either you need to think more about your learnersâ€™ mental models, or your question simply isnâ€™t a good starting point for an MCQ.

# Worked examples: continue with "modify/adapt the problem"

> <span style="color:grey">You have sorted your to-be-washed-at 40 degrees pile of white clothes. You noticed a tomato stain on your favourite (cotton) t-shirt, and rubbed in 5 ml of an enzymatic stain remover to pre-treat the stain before setting up a 40C permanent pressure ("mix") washing cycle with 800 rpm spin. </span>

That cycle has finished, and now you are setting the next load of white clothes at 60 degrees, without stains. Which settings would you select on your washing machine?

# "Actual" problems
.center[![Unsplash's perfect laundry pile](images/annie-spratt-5TfCI4nj6B4-unsplash.jpg)]

Provide a pile of laundry (without staining that requires treatment). Ask to sort into piles based on garment labels and colours. Make sure to get group feedback first before presenting to "instructor"

# Challenges: Change context

- <i>"Once learners have had an opportunity to practice using a concept in the same context as it was originally taught (direct application challenges), itâ€™s time to stretch their understanding by asking them to apply the same concept in a different context."</i>

# Aside: How does live coding factor into this?

* Live coding is an assessment
* Attention and accuracy check. 
  * Are they aware of *exactly* what is being written? 
  * Errors
  * Expectations of the medium (precision and syntax)
* It is a formative assessment

# Exercise: Design formative assessments needed to accomplish summative task.

In your groups, go back to the Google docs. Start to design some formative assessements you might use to build towards your summative task.

Make sure you design at least one:

- MCQ
- Parson's problems
- Fill in the blank
- Faded example
- Actual problem
- Context-changing problem

1. DB Reflection: Reflect on choice of formative assessments.
1. B NEW Added first draft allocation of challenge+code+narrative to satisfy objectives.
1. B Aside: Temporal budgets and overkill
1. B Aside: How does live coding factor into this?
Removed? Live coding is the simplest possible formative assessment: follow along.
 
1. B Time yourself talking about the code you're typing, and then *do* your challenges. This *2 is your minimum time (you already know the answers).
1. D Run a pilot: Teach your lesson from outline to your helpers and co-instructors
1. D Run a pilot: While issues: iterate
1. D Run a pilot: Flesh out narrative from outline, move outline into instructor notes
1. B Summative exercise: proving that we've designed a workshop??

# Time Yourself Doing and Talking

* Challenges and narrative are only half the battle.
* Exercises are slow, live-coding is slow
* For each challenge plus its outline:
  * Time yourself talking through the outline and doing each challenge
  * Multiply that time by two: 
    * You know what you mean
    * You know what the answers are
    * You are not interrupted and likely not speaking at a slow presentation pace
  * This is your minimum time

# Talking to you aside 3: Temporal budgets and overkill

* You will write too much
* You will design too much
* What you design will suffer from the "expert awareness gap"
* Aim low and outline

Lesson 1. *Don't overprepare:* spend time on what you know you will present

Lesson 2. *Don't crowd the lesson:* allocating time for answering questions about the content and discussion about the lesson during your alpha preparations provides a "crumple zone" for emergencies (a challenge is too hard or an explanation needs to be redone.)

???

Overprepare: you know your content and can unpack it and discuss it more thoroughly through ad-libbing. Adding content ahead of time that you know you won't get to wastes your time.

Crowd the lesson: As they note in instructor training, it is better to go too slowly and bore some of the more expert members of your audience than it is to go too quickly and alienate those who are unsure. This heuristic is even more critical in an alpha lesson where you don't know how useful any of your planned explanations are. Aiming for 80% of your target time during initial development at the very worst allows for discussion at the end of an episode where your class can reflect on what went well and what needs improvement.

# Make a concept map

A concept map is a directed acyclic graph which represents the relationships and **dependencies** of concepts in the workshop. 

* Your summative assessment is your goal/activity at the center.
* That activity depends on skills taught by the formative assessments
* Each assessment has necessary prior concepts which must be explained

# Episodes, challenges, narrative, and time-budget



???
1. B First draft: Allocate challenge+code+narrative to each episode to satisfy learning objectives
---
# Run a pilot

1. Teach the lesson early!
  - If  you have the time/bandwidth, teach/work through your lesson with your co-instructors and helpers

2. The first delivery of every course is just as much about you learning as it is about your learners: reflect on everything!
 - Github issues for the advanced
 - Paper notes/post-its work too!
 - Take notes on timing, moments of confusion, mismatches between actual students and personified expectations, "argh" failures and successes.
 - Get LOTS of [feedback](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/index.html): minute cards, one-up-one-down, surveys, unstructured/structured interviews etc

---
# Run a pilot: Move from outline to text, use the outline as instructor notes

???
1. D Run a pilot: Flesh out narrative from outline, move outline into instructor notes

---
# Summative challenge: Using the combined group doc of your topic, plan a workshop.

* This workshop should have:
  * personae, 
  * Skill goals
  * 1 summative assessment, 
  * 2 formative assessments, 
  * 2 bulletpoints per formative assessment, 
  * and be sorted into episodes. 

We will resume discussion in 10 minutes.

# Wrapping up

* Discussion of summative challenges
* Questions from the session
* Minute cards

# Other stuff we did (without being explicit)
1. Tried to combine visual and auditory information
2. Didn't given the whole picture at once (but this can be useful as well)

<li> Figure out who your learners are and what their goals are. </li>
<li> Create the summative assessment for the lesson to give yourself a target. </li>
<li> Itemize the knowledge and skills that assessment relies on and create formative assessments to check on each while learning is taking place. </li>
<li> Order those formative assessments in a way that respects their dependencies, i.e., so that they build on each other. </li>
<li> Estimate the time required to cover each topic and perform its related formative assessment, then cut material that there isn't time for. </li>
<li> Write lessons to connect each formative assessment to the next (which is usually much easier than writing an entire lesson at once). </li>
<li> Double-check your language and examples to ensure that they address your learners' goals and won't demotivate them. </li>
<li> Derive learning objectives and key points from the lesson to share with your learners and coinstructors. The former makes the lesson findable, while the latter gives you and your coinstructors a quick way to check what the lesson actually covers. </li>
<li> Put everything online under an open license for other people to download, modify, and contribute to. </li>
