# Alex

-  Alex is a PhD-qualified particle physicist who learned to use python for research work. During PhD, delivering introductory programming training with a cross-university training organisation as a casual tutor. 
-  After graduation, found employment with this organisation as a full-time trainer. 
-  Would like to grow in role by developing new training, and doesn't really know where to start.
-  Has tried by making a list of topics to cover in a new course.
-  Hasn't been exposed to any learning theory, received any training in instruction beyond that learned from peers on the job - and doesn't feel comfortable reaching out to trainers around who do have some of this background for support, as most of them are not employed on a full-time contracts (imposter syndrome). 
-  Deeply concerned about climate change. 

- Ali - attended Toby's talk, Carpentries instructor wanting to stretch their wings and begin contributing to some of the incubator lessons. Does not "code".
- Uri - another instructor trainer with extensive course developer experience. Interested in what we have to say "just because".
- Karen - watching session later on YouTube, not familiar with Carpentries philosophy or teaching style


# Ali
- Ali works as a curator for the State Library of NSW. As part of a past project, Ali realised how critical robust metadata was for speeding up the process of providing access to the library's vast archives of non-manuscript resources. This led Ali to become a Carpentries instructor, running Library Carpentry workshops in State and local libraries across Australia. 
- Ali is an artist, and loves to draw and create digital works for events like Vivid Sydney
- Ali wants to help out with the [R for artists](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/r-for-artists) incubator lesson, but doesn't know where to start
- Ali's partner always does all of the laundry (there is a reason this matters!)

# Uri
- Uri is an Instructor Trainer who has been on many calls with Darya & Brian and is curious to see what the heck they're up to with this meta-meta lesson
- Uri is employed as a training coordinator for a major South American researcher training organisation, and spends most time at work teaching others how to teach and managing them - not so much course developing anymore
- Uri has extensive training in pedagogy and course development, and has used reverse design to develop both canonical undergraduate courses as well as Carpentries-style workshops

# Karen
- Karen is a university lecturer who came across the Carpentries YouTube thanks to it's recommendation algorithms
- Karen is interested to watch this video to get a sense of how the Carpentries does course development, wondering whether there are things that he can pick up and adopt in his own work
- Karen's native language is not English, and he is red/green colourblind
