-  Alex is a PhD-qualified particle physicist who learned to use python for research work. During PhD, delivering introductory programming training with a cross-university training organisation as a casual tutor. 
-  After graduation, found employment with this organisation as a full-time trainer. 
-  Would like to grow in role by developing new training, and doesn't really know where to start.
-  Has tried by making a list of topics to cover in a new course.
-  Hasn't been exposed to any learning theory, received any training in instruction beyond that learned from peers on the job - and doesn't feel comfortable reaching out to trainers around who do have some of this background for support, as most of them are not employed on a full-time contracts (imposter syndrome). 
-  Deeply concerned about climate change.
